# Product Requirements Document: Netlify Status Indicator for VS Code

## Overview

A VS Code extension that displays real-time Netlify deployment status in the status bar, providing developers with immediate visibility into their site's deployment progress and health.

## Problem Statement

Developers using Netlify for deployments often need to switch between VS Code and the Netlify dashboard to check deployment status. This context switching disrupts workflow and reduces productivity.

## Solution

Create a VS Code extension that displays a Netlify status indicator in the bottom status bar, showing:
- Current deployment status
- Site health indicators  
- Quick access to deployment logs and settings

## Target Users

- Frontend developers using Netlify for hosting
- Full-stack developers managing multiple Netlify sites
- Teams using VS Code as their primary development environment

## Core Features

### 1. Status Bar Indicator
- **Status Display**: Show current deployment status (building, success, failed, etc.)
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded status icons (green=success, yellow=building, red=failed)
- **Site Name**: Display the active site name when configured
- **Click Actions**: Open Netlify dashboard or deployment logs on click

### 2. Authentication & Configuration
- **Netlify API Integration**: Authenticate with Netlify API using personal access tokens
- **Site Selection**: Choose which Netlify site to monitor
- **Auto-detection**: Automatically detect Netlify configuration from netlify.toml or deploy settings

### 3. Real-time Updates
- **Polling**: Regular status checks (configurable interval, default 30 seconds)
- **WebSocket Support**: Real-time updates when available
- **Manual Refresh**: Option to manually refresh status

### 4. Notifications
- **Deployment Completion**: Notify when deployments complete (success/failure)
- **Build Failures**: Alert on build failures with option to view logs
- **Configurable Alerts**: Allow users to enable/disable different notification types

## Technical Requirements

### VS Code Integration
- **Status Bar Item**: Primary UI element in VS Code status bar
- **Command Palette**: Commands for configuration and manual actions
- **Settings Integration**: Use VS Code settings for configuration storage

### Netlify API
- **REST API**: Use Netlify's REST API for deployment status
- **Authentication**: Personal access token authentication
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect API rate limits and implement backoff strategies

### Performance
- **Minimal Resource Usage**: Lightweight polling and caching
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures and network issues
- **Startup Performance**: Fast extension activation

## User Experience

### Setup Flow
1. Install extension from VS Code marketplace
2. Run "Configure Netlify" command from Command Palette
3. Enter Netlify personal access token
4. Select site to monitor from dropdown
5. Status indicator appears in status bar

### Daily Usage
- Status indicator shows current deployment state
- Click indicator to open Netlify dashboard
- Receive notifications for deployment events
- Use Command Palette for configuration changes

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption**: Number of active installations
- **Engagement**: Frequency of status bar clicks and command usage
- **User Satisfaction**: Extension ratings and feedback
- **Performance**: Extension activation time and resource usage

## Future Enhancements

- **Multiple Site Support**: Monitor multiple Netlify sites simultaneously
- **Branch Deployments**: Show status for different branch deployments
- **Deploy Previews**: Integration with Netlify's deploy preview system
- **Team Features**: Shared configurations for team environments
- **Analytics Integration**: Display site analytics data

## Risk Mitigation

- **API Changes**: Monitor Netlify API changes and maintain compatibility
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement proper rate limiting to avoid API quota issues
- **Security**: Secure token storage using VS Code's secret storage API
- **Performance**: Regular performance monitoring and optimization

## Timeline

- **Phase 1** (Weeks 1-2): Core status bar indicator and basic API integration
- **Phase 2** (Weeks 3-4): Authentication, site selection, and configuration
- **Phase 3** (Weeks 5-6): Notifications, error handling, and polish
- **Phase 4** (Weeks 7-8): Testing, documentation, and marketplace submission

## Dependencies

- **VS Code Extension API**: Status bar, commands, settings, notifications
- **Netlify API**: Deployment status and site information
- **Node.js Libraries**: HTTP client, authentication helpers
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and development tooling
